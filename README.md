<h2>ðŸ’½ Vulnerability Management with NESSUS ESSENTIALS homelab </h2>
<br />

This repository is for the [<b>â—» Vulnerability Management with NESSUS ESSENTIALS homelab</b>](https://tektsunami.com/alabnessus.html) , you can read more about it on my website where I explain the whole lab and process in details. <br />

Vulnerability management is a continuous process of assessing your assets and discovering vulnerabilities, remediating them to an acceptable risk and then repeating the cycle. The goal is to remediate vulnerabilities and mitigate risk. <br />
There is however a lot to take into account when formulating a plan for the whole Vulnerability Mangament process, before even starting to perform scans and dealing with the vulnerabilities. Things like drafting policies, getting department and other employees on board, using the proper Management platform, and so on. <br />
In this lab I will focus more on the practical side of Vulnerability Management.

<br />

ðŸ›  Tools used:  <br />
- <b>Oracle VirtualBox VMM</b> (otherwise, VMware or Hyper-V) <br />
- <b>Virtual Machine with Windows 10 Pro</b> <br />
- <b>Nessus Essentials</b> <br /> <br />

Alternatively, if you don't want to use Nessus Essentials I recommend using <b>OpenVAS</b> as your Vulnerability Management platform.

<br />
